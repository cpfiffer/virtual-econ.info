### Royal Economic Society

The COVID-19 outbreak has provoked a rapid and, in many cases, unprecedented policy response from government. And many economists are playing a role in designing and analysing such policies along with studying the impact that COVID-19 is having. Although there are historical parallels with some aspects of this episode, the nature of the shock is unique and studying it requires careful thinking about the models and frameworks that we use, collecting and analysing new data as well as studying implications from existing data sets. 

Over the coming weeks, the RES will be holding a series of webinars with leading economists. Some will be quite open ended while others will tackle specific issues. All are intended to bring serious economic thinking to bear on important and complex issues.

### Online Spatial and Urban Seminar

The Online Spatial and Urban Seminar (OSUS) is organizing a twice monthly online seminar series on urban economics. We aim to provide engaging seminars featuring economists from a variety of institutions, experience levels, and fields unified by an interest in urban questions.

At OSUS, we interpret "spatial and urban" broadly, recognizing that many fields utilize spatial variation and methods, and that a lot of economics takes place in cities! As such, we encourage participation from economists in fields including, but not limited to, housing, real estate, transportation, trade, local public goods provision, the spatial distribution of activities, economic geography, and urban or regional policy.
